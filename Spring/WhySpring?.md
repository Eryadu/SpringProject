## Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) in Spring aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting
 concerns. Cross-cutting concerns are functionalities needed across different parts of an application, such as logging,
  security, and transaction management. Instead of scattering these concerns throughout the code, AOP allows defining
  them in one place and applying them where needed.
-- AOP achieves this by introducing aspects, which are modular units that encapsulate cross-cutting concerns.
